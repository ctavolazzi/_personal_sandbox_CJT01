# Devlog: 2025-12-08

## Summary
Initial setup of the personal sandbox repository.

## Work Completed

### Repository Setup
- Initialized Git repository
- Connected to GitHub remote
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for multi-language support
- Created README.md with project structure documentation
- Added MIT LICENSE
- Established Johnny Decimal organization in `_work_efforts_`

### Folder Structure Created
```

├── scripts/
├── snippets/
├── learning/
└── scratch/ (gitignored)
```

## Decisions Made
- Used MIT License for maximum flexibility
- Implemented Johnny Decimal for work effort organization
- Created comprehensive .gitignore covering multiple languages/frameworks
- Kept `/scratch/` gitignored for temporary work

## Next Steps
- Start adding projects as needed
- Create work efforts for any multi-step tasks
- Keep devlog updated with progress

## 15:19 PST - Added Tools Package

### What
Created `tools/` directory with Decision Matrix utility for quantitative decision-making.

### Why
- Frequently-used utility anticipated for comparing options against weighted criteria
- Separate from `scripts/` (shell automation) and `snippets/` (code fragments)
- Provides structured decision support with multiple analysis methods

### Files Added
```
tools/
├── __init__.py           # Package exports
└── decision_matrix.py    # Decision matrix utility (~600 lines)
```

### Usage
```python
from tools.decision_matrix import make_decision

result = make_decision(
    options=["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"],
    criteria=["Cost", "Speed", "Quality"],
    scores={
        "Option A": [7, 8, 6],
        "Option B": [9, 5, 7],
        "Option C": [6, 9, 8]
    },
    weights=[0.3, 0.2, 0.5]
)
print(result)
```

### Features
- 4 analysis methods: weighted, normalized, ranking, best-worst
- Confidence scoring with warnings for close decisions
- Strengths/weaknesses breakdown per option
- JSON export for serialization
- Comparison tables and method consensus

### Decisions Made
- **Folder name:** `tools/` chosen over `utils/` — clearer distinction from existing `scripts/`
- **No work effort created:** Task was straightforward, documented in devlog instead
- **Import path:** `from tools.decision_matrix import make_decision` (simple, direct)

## 15:25 PST - Resolved Decision Matrix Duplication

### Issue Identified
Two `decision_matrix.py` files existed:
- `scripts/decision_matrix.py` (78 lines) — simple version
- `tools/decision_matrix.py` (808 lines) — full-featured version

### Initial Decision: Keep Both
Initially decided to keep both since they had different APIs and `evaluate_testing_framework.py` depended on the scripts version.

### Revised Decision: Consolidate ✅
User correctly identified this would cause confusion. Proper fix:

1. **Migrated** `evaluate_testing_framework.py` to use `tools/decision_matrix.py`
2. **Deleted** `scripts/decision_matrix.py`
3. **Single source of truth** now in `tools/`

### Final Structure
```
scripts/
└── evaluate_testing_framework.py   # Now imports from tools/

tools/
├── __init__.py
└── decision_matrix.py              # Single source of truth (808 lines)
```

### Changes to evaluate_testing_framework.py
- Added `sys.path` adjustment for project root import
- Converted data structure from `Alternative` dataclass to `make_decision()` API
- Now gets richer output (confidence scores, strengths/weaknesses, comparison tables)
